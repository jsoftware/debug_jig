Augmented Display of J results

At this point jig is only supported in jqt although plans are to have it ported to JHS soon.
jig is a script which takes the representation of a noun and converts it to an svg format that allows the user to interactively discover the properites of the noun.
It is loaded by loading jig.ijs which then uses the version to seelct the correct form of jig. j901 and j902 share the same code, although in the beta a separate code for j902 
was generated and it remains in the manifest as an option if some of the issues return.
There is a lab that supports jig in the standard lab file under the name of Jig Augmented Display.
